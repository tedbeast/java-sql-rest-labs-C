     * Write a sorting algorithm for an array, and return a sorted array.

     * I recommend trying first to write a sorting algorithm yourself, while making extensive use of the debugger to see
     * how the values are shifting about.
     *
     * (think of how a human might try to do this - you may have an inefficient solution. Or, you may also try
     * research the code for a sorting algorithm yourself, and seeing how the logic works through time using
     * the debugger!)
     *
     * here's a good sorting algorithm to try.
     * https://www.programiz.com/dsa/selection-sort
     *
     * The sorting algorithm you're likely to write here is probably O(n^2), because it involves a nested for loop,
     * which usually results to the amount of work needed to complete a problem scaling quadratically with respect
     * to the amount of items. There are O(n*log(n)) sorting algorithms as well.
     *
     * @param nums an array of unsorted numbers.
     * @return an array containing the values of nums, but sorted.
