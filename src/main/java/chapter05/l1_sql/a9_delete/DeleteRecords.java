/**
 * SQL sublanguage: DML (Data Manipulation Language)

 * The "DELETE" keyword is utilized to remove records based on a condition.
 *
 * The syntax for deleting records from a table is as follows:
 * DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
 *
 * NOTE: Whenever you execute a DELETE statement, have a WHERE condition that identifies exactly what records you would
 * like to delete. Leaving this out will remove ALL records from the table.
