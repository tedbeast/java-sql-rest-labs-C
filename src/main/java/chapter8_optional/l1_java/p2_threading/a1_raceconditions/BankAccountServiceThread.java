 * Notice that this thread implements Runnable, which is a functional interface.

 * Runnable allows Java to run this class as an independent thread, an independent execution of Java code that
 * can run at the same time as other executions of Java, while still belonging to the same application and sharing
 * memory & objects with other threads. Using threads can lead to better performance when the application either
 * needs to wait constantly (such as when it is waiting for responses sent over the web), or if we are leveraging
 * multiple cores of a processor.
 *
 * Nothing in this class should be changed.
