/**
 * We are used to searching for items in a list by traversing the list and checking each value.
 * While this is true in an unsorted list, a sorted list is a different case:
 * how do we search for a word in a dictionary, for instance? do we look at every word?
 * No, we look at the middle of a dictionary and see if our word is to the 'left' or the 'right' of the page we opened
 * to, and repeat the process until we are on the page we need.
 * The process in this case would be log2(n) rather than n, because we divide the size of the problem in half
 * for every time we search for our word again.
 *
 * The test cases will be testing for at least a 10x speedup in real-time over the baseline,
 * n time solution, for an input of nearly a billion numbers.
