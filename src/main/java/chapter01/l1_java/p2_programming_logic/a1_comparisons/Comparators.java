/**
 * If we want to make programs that "do something", we're going to need to create instructions that change
 * depending on the current state of the program.
 * Therefore, we're inevitably going to run into boolean expressions (ie true/false statements).
 * Let's start with the different ways to compare two numbers, in this case a and b.
 *
 * A boolean expression, such as a==b, will resolve to a boolean value. This works the same way as how a math
 * equation resolves to a number - for instance, 4*5 resolves to 9. Therefore, all problems in this file can be
 * written with one line - such as return a==b;
